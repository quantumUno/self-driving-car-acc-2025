# Interpretation

  This section details our approach to interpreting sensor data to detect lanes and traffic lights.

  ## Why This Matters
  Interpretation enables the QCar to understand its environment for safe navigation.

  ## Setup in Self-Driving Car Studio
  - **Traffic Lights**: Detected via camera using OpenCV (color-based).
  - **Map**: Processed lane data from Detailed Scenario.

  ## Prerequisites
  - ROS 2 Humble, Python 3.8+, OpenCV, NumPy.
  - ROS packages: `cv_bridge`.

  ## Installation
  1. Install dependencies.
  2. Download this repository.

  ## Code Walkthrough
  `code/interpretation_node.py` processes images for lane and traffic light detection.

  ### Example Code
  ```python
  import rclpy
  from rclpy.node import Node
  from sensor_msgs.msg import Image
  from cv_bridge import flets its own `README.md` files, and upload images to `examples/`.
